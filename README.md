Working of the Machine Learning Model :

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, such as computer science, linguistics, and statistics, to enable computers to perform various tasks with natural language data, such as text and speech.

A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a simple way to represent text data for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It involves two steps:

Creating a vocabulary of words from a collection of documents.
Counting the occurrence of each word in each document.

The result is a matrix of word counts, where each row represents a document and each column represents a word. The order and structure of the words in the documents are ignored, only the frequency of each word is considered. This is why it is called a “bag” of words.

A bag-of-words model can be used for various NLP applications, such as:

Text classification: assigning a label to a document based on its content, such as spam detection or sentiment analysis.

Text clustering: grouping similar documents together based on their content, such as topic modeling or document retrieval.

Text summarization: generating a short summary of a document based on its main points, such as news headlines or abstracts.

How to Run a Custom Test Statement ? 

1)In the given github link open the natural_language_processing.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook Environment
2)Download the SectionsCopy.csv file and paste it in the same directory as of the NoteBook
3)Paste your test FIR statement as a “t” variable in the 7th cell and run all the Cells
You can see the predicted outputs at the end of the Code
