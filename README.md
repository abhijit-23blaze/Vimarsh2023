# Vimarsh2023

note to judges: I am Abhijit Patil a student of the Indian Institue of Information Technoloy Sri City , as you might be aware there was a very massive cyclone that recently hit us due to which there was no electricity here for two days and among all of this we also had our endsemester examinations which are still going on as i am writing this . 
we have a very unique and extreamly innovative idea which can actually change the law enforcement field .but due to these extreme cirmustances we were not really able to express that through the presentation video . we have soo amny more features planned for the app and also the future of the app but we couldn't do it due to the above circumstances.
we have very hastily put togather a video and app along with the presentaion in one day i.e today is 9 dec we have exam today morning till 4:30 and after that we have been constantly working on this because we know what an incredibly oppourtunity this is but delivering all of our ideas is not a task of one day .
all i am asking is consideration from your side considering the circum stances and a second chance to deliver better .
